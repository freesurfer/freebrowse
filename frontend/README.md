ðŸš§ This is a work in progress ðŸš§

## set up environments and install dependencies

Requirements:
- Node.js (for frontend environment)
- npm (for frontend environment)
- pixi (for backend environment)
- git


### frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### backend

```bash
cd backend
pixi install
```

## run the frontend in development mode

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## run the backend in development mode

This hot reloads the backend when changes are made to the code.

```bash
cd backend
pixi run dev
```

## build the frontend for production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
